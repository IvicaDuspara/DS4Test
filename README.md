## Introduction
I decided that it would be fun to learn more about Linux device drivers. So I decided to 
write this program. Strictly speaking this program is not a driver. This 
is merely communication test.

This program is intended a stepping stone for future work where I plan to write
user-space driver which would allow:

* Connection via USB or Bluetooth
* Binding joystick buttons to keyboard / mouse input
* Changing light bar color
* Macro commands (pressing a button causes rumble and light bar change etc.)
* Saving configurations of joystick
